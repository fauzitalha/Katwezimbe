Alternatively, if you are using the MVVM pattern and would like to Bind the tap to an ICommand in the ViewModel, that can be achieved like this:

<StackLayout Grid.Column="0" Grid.Row="0" BackgroundColor="#313FA0">
    <StackLayout.GestureRecognizers>
        <TapGestureRecognizer Command="{Binding TapCommand}"/>
    </StackLayout.GestureRecognizers>
</StackLayout>



In your ViewModel you would have:

private ICommand _tapCommand;
pubic ICommand TapCommand => (_tapCommand ?? _tapCommand = new Command(OnTapped));

void OnTapped() 
{
    // Do stuff
}
